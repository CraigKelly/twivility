# Client folder readme

This folder is served statically as `/client` by the Twvility service and is our
HTML5 client interface.

However, there are a few exceptions:

* main.html - The page served if someone browses to `/`
* api-default.html - The page served if someone browses to `/api`
* main.css - The css file used by main.html and api-default.html
